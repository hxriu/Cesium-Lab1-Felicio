				<h1>Skullgirls</h1>
				<p>The Skullheart, an ancient relic that has the power to grant any wish so long as the wish was pure, has fallen into the hands of Marie, turning her into the Skullgirl. 
				Eight other girls, all of which have their own motivation for getting the Skullheart or killing Marie, are now on the hunt for the Skullgirl.</p>
